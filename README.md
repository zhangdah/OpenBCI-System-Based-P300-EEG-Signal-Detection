# Overview of the Project
This repository reuses the state-of-the-art One Convolution Layer Neural Network (OCLNN) [1] to compare the impacts of different channel selection methods. By reducing the channels from 64 to 8, 4, and 1, P300 detection accuracy decreases from 92% to 85% and the model parameters reduce from 16,882 to 1,522, suggesting that an effective selection of the channels can significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining classification accuracy. The dataset used in this project is [BCI Competition II - Data set IIb](http://www.bbci.de/competition/ii/). Part of the code from this [repository](https://github.com/gibranfp/P300-CNNT) is used.
